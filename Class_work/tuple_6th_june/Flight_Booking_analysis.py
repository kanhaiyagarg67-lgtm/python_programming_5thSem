'''Program for the Flight Booking Analysis 
 Problem Statement 
 A flight reservation system stores passenger records as tuples: 
 bookings = ( 
     ("P101", "Delhi", "Confirmed"), 
     ("P102", "Mumbai", "Waiting"), 
     ("P103", "Delhi", "Confirmed"), 
     ("P104", "Chennai", "Cancelled"), 
     ("P105", "Mumbai", "Confirmed"), 
     ("P106", "Delhi", "Waiting") 
 ) 
Where: 
 • Passenger ID  
 • Destination  
 • Booking Status  
 Tasks 
 Write a Python program to: 
 1. Display all passengers whose booking status is Confirmed.  
 2. Count the number of passengers travelling to Delhi.  
 3. Count Confirmed, Waiting, and Cancelled bookings separately.  
 4. Create a list containing passenger IDs with Waiting status.  
 5. Determine which destination has the highest number of bookings.  
 Sample Output 
 Confirmed Passengers: 
 P101 Delhi 
 P103 Delhi 
 P105 Mumbai 
 
 Passengers Travelling to Delhi: 3 
 
 Confirmed: 3 
 Waiting: 2 
 Cancelled: 1 
 
 Waiting List: 
 ['P102', 'P106'] 
 
 Most Booked Destination: 
 Delhi
